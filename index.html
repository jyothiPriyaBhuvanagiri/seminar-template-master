    	<h2>4. Phases Of Web Engineering Quo Vadis</h2>
        <h3>4.1. There are three phases for this Web Engineering Quo Vadis.</h3>
        <h4>4.1.1. Research Planning</h4>
    	<p>
            To undertake the research in Web Engineering Quo Vadis and identify the current trends,
            we initiated the research planning phase.
            we were given four distinct research questions that would guide our investigation.

        </p>
        <img src=  "pictures/Phases_of_web_Engineering_quo_vadis.png" alt="alternative-text"/>
        <figcaption>
            <strong>figure </strong>:Phases of Web Engineering Quo Vadis</a>.
        </figcaption>

        <h4>4.1.2. Data Collection</h4>
    	<p>
            During the data collection phase of Web Engineering Quo Vadis, a systematic approach was adopted to
            gather the relevant data from wide range of resources. we were given 5 years of conference papers and
            journals of web engineering from that we have gathered the relevant data for the analyzing the four research
            questions. after the initial screening, the Conference Papers and Journal Articles are carefully reviewed and
            relevant data were collected. This includes the name of the Title, Abstract, Keywords, Authors, Affiliations, Length of Publication,
            Citations, Volume Number, Page Number, Links, Country, Venue, Name of issue, Year.
            The data collection process involved systematically organizing the extracted data for further analysis.
            The collected data served as a valuable resource for analyzing the four research questions.

        </p>
        <h4>4.1.3. Data Analysis</h4>
    	<p>
            Once the data has been gathered, we then analyze it using the proper analysis methods.
            To obtain valuable insights and reach conclusions, this phase involves gathering, cleaning, and analyzing the data.
            First, we categorized the data into relevant categories. The data's correct arrangement enabled us to evaluate and
            visualize without suffering any negative side effects.

            Once the data is organized, we start cleaning it, which means deleting duplicate data and adding the missing values.
            By ensuring that the data is clean, the analysis results are more accurate and reliable.
            After the data collection, the processed data is ready for visualization.
            This data analysis helped us visualize the distinct research questions accurately.
    	</p>
        <h4>4.1.4 Visualization Phase</h4>
    	<p>

            The third phase is data visualization, which is the crucial part in the research of Web Engineering Quo Vadis as it gives the final result of this research.
            We have four different questions to do this visualization. For the visualization, we used different methods, such as bar graphs,
            which allow for the comparison of different categories,and pie charts, which are ideal for representing the percentages.
            Finally, with this visualization, we draw the current trend in Web Engineering based on the data collection of the past
            five years.

    	<h2>3. Data Resources</h2>

    	<p>
            The data resources we used for this research in Web Engineering Quo Vadis take the form of two primary resources
            ICWE <a href="#s1">[1]</a> stands for International Conference on Web Engineering, and JWE stands for Journal of Web Engineering<a href="s2">[2]</a> .
            It serves as a valuable source of scholarly articles and research papers in the field.
            SpringerLink is one of the digital library which is widely used website that provides vast collection of scientific and technical publications.
            we  used for collecting conference papers data.
            RiverPublisher is one of the websites that host a range of scientific Journals, including Journals of Web Engineering
            is used to collect the data related to  Journals of web engineering.

        <h3>4.2. Funktionsbeispiele</h3>

    <p>
        Ein sehr positiver Aspekt ist, dass man die eigene Cloud auch anderen zugänglich machen kann. Der Admin kann Benutzer anlegen und diese Gruppen sowie
        Rechte zuweisen (siehe Abb.1). Diese können ihre eigenen Daten hochladen, verwalten, teilen und miteinander interagieren.
    </p>
    	<figure>
          <img src="benutzer.png" alt="Liste aller Benutzer"/>
          <figcaption>
            <strong>Abbildung 1</strong>: Liste der eingetragenen Benutzer <a href="#r13">[13]</a>.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
    <p>
        Beim Teilen gibt es verschiedene Möglichkeiten dieses zu gestalten. Zum einen können Dateien mit ganzen Gruppen oder einzelnen Personen geteilt werden.
        Des Weiteren lassen sich Optionen wie „kann bearbeiten“, „aktualisieren“, „löschen“ und „teilen“ auswählen. Auch das Setzen eines Ablaufdatums ist möglich,
        sowie eine zusätzliche Mitteilung per Email mit der Information, dass etwas mit einem geteilt wurde. Aber auch das Teilen mit Dritten, die nicht zu den
        eingetragenen Benutzern gehören, ist möglich. Hierfür orientiert sich ownCloud an Dropbox oder auch Google, indem es den Link zum kopieren und weiterleiten gibt
        (siehe Abb 2).
    </p>

          <img src="shareoptions.png" alt="Teilen"/>

        </figure>
    <p>
        Gerade in Hinblick auf das Zusammenarbeiten und Teilen von Daten ist die Übersicht der neusten Aktivitäten sehr nützlich. Hier werden alle Aktivitäten, die
        einen selbst betreffen mit zusätzlichen Details angezeigt (siehe Abb.3).

        <h2>5. Fazit</h2>

    <p>
        Die Vorteile der Nutzung von Cloud Diensten liegt klar auf der Hand: Die Daten sind unabhängig von Standort und Gerät immer abrufbar. Im Falle eines
        Schadens an der Festplatte oder ähnlichem sind zudem diese Daten nicht verloren. Auch vereinfacht es Projektarbeiten. Doch es gibt immer zwei Seiten
        einer Medaille und so sollte sich jeder bewusst sein, dass wenn man seine Daten, seien es persönliche, geschäftliche, belanglose oder sensible Daten, online hochlädt und 
    	auf fremden Servern speichert, die theoretische Möglichkeit besteht, dass jemand Fremdes sich leichter und unter Umständen unbemerkt Zugriff zu diesen Daten beschaffen kann.
    </p>
    <p>
        Große Anbieter wie Dropbox und Google versprechen viel Leistung, gerade auch in Hinblick auf Sicherheit, aber so zeigte sich besonders im letzten Jahr wie
        viel hinter den Kulissen geschieht, ausgehend von der Politik und den Geheimdiensten, von dem Anwender nichts mitbekommen. Die besten
        Verschlüsselungsalgorithmen bei der Übertragung von Daten oder beim Ablegen der selbigen auf den Servern nützen nichts, wenn die Schlüssel von den Firmen
        selbst verwaltet werden und sie auf Verlangen der Regierung diese herausgeben müssen.
    </p>
    <p>
        Eine Alternative ist sicher die zusätzliche lokale Verschlüsselung, so wie sie Boxcryptor anbietet. Oder auch gänzlich auf das Zwischenspeichern auf
        Servern zu verzichten und Daten direkt zu Synchronisieren, so wie BitTorrent Sync es vorschlägt. Die Idee sich seine eigene Cloud aufzusetzen erscheint im
        ersten Moment auch eine interessante Alternative zu sein. Jedoch kann dieser Enthusiasmus schnell verfliegen, denn die Herausforderung diese so sicher wie
        möglich zu gestalten und den gleichen Service zu bieten wie die Vorbilder, ist doch größer als anfänglich gedacht. Viel Freiheit in Gestaltung und
        Umsetzung bedeutet in diesem Fall auch sehr viel Verantwortung, welche nur mit Grundkenntnissen kaum erfüllbar ist.
